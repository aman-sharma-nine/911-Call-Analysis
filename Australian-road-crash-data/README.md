# Australian Road Deaths Database
This notebook explores the patterns and insights from the data I downloaded from :   
[title](https://bitre.gov.au/statistics/safety/fatal_road_crash_database.aspx)

We will do the EDA and visualisation of the dataset to find the number of fatalities in each State, States with most number of people killed on roads, Months where crashes are shown to be increased etc.

The Australian Road Deaths Database (ARDD) is maintained and published by BITRE. It commenced in 1989 and is updated on a monthly basis.  
The ARDD contains basic demographic and crash details of people who have died in an Australian road crash. Every fatal road traffic crash in Australia is in scope, and information is included for all people who were killed.
